RandoMesh works by taking your geometry and adding random subdivisions to it. It was created to start learning Python in Blender and automate some of my workflow, so expect bugs. **Make sure to always save your work before using this addon!**

I've found the best results occur with meshes under 5000 polygons. Lots of iterations can really slow things down, so beware. Opening blender from a terminal will give you detailed output of each step of the process.

#### Example (Subdivision smoothing set to 1.0)
